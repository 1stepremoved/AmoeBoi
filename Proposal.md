# Osmosis

Osmosis is a become-the-largest type of game, wherein you control a single amoeba that navigates the board absorbing smaller amoeba until it becomes the largest blob on the board. Movement is controlled by the mouse: clicking one direction will emit small bubbles from the player's ameoba, altering it's momentum but sacrifcing a small amount of mass. Holding down the mouse will create large bubbles that will propel the player farther, but sacrifice more mass. Ameoba's that are touched by larger ameoba's will not be immediately absorbed, but lose mass at a speed proportionate to the amount of overlap between the two ameoba's until there is no overlap.

### MVPs
 * Convincing physics for acceleration, and
 * Smooth absorption of smaller amoeba
 * No unwinnable scenarios (when generating ameobas, make certain there's a way to become the largest)
 * Gradient coloring to indicate whether ameoba's are smaller or larger than the player's amoeba
